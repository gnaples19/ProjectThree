Project 3 for Interactive Game Development

Name: You Are Late for Work at the Zoo

Intent: The Intent of this game is to have the player engaged for more than 5 minutes, attempting to collect the animals running lose in the zoo.

Narrative Structure: Aspects of the game are revealed to the character in on screen prompts, instructing the character.

Mechanics: The player can walk around, jump, and collide with objects. The player's goal is to pick up all zoo animals. As he has arrived to work late.

Aesthetics: The Aesthetics are very cartoonish, many sprites are incorporated in a more pixelated style, but the overall Aesthetic of the game should be cartoon

Joys and Struggles: Early development now goes a lot smoother since we have more experience, and play testing is a lot more fun since the games we design get more and more interactive. The struggles are now that our games are getting more complex, the few issues we run into are a little harder to figure out because there are so many different elements working cohesively. Also, you have to be delicate working in partners on this because the merge conflicts can be catastrophic.
